# SIGILS
The **Shack Industries Graphical Item Logistics Software** (SIGILS) is a ComputerCraft program for transferring items between Minecraft inventories and machines that are connected by a wired modem to a ComputerCraft computer.

Using the SIGILS Editor on a web browser, virtual item pipes can be created between chests, furnaces, and/or modded inventories to transfer items between their slots. Filters can be added for even more flexibility, allowing you to create automated factories entirely using SIGILS.
